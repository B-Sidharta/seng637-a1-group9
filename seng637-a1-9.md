# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

This assignment is about understanding software testing through practical experience. In this assignment specifically, the system under test (SUT) is an ATM simulation system developed by Gordon College. 

What we knew before this assignment:

**Issue tracking systems** are used to report, track and manage bugs / issues of a software system. For this assignment our group agreed to utilize Jira Software to report and track bugs. Jira is widely used in industry and some of the members in our group has been exposed through work and internships. When a bug is found, an issue is created and it is assigned a severity and priority level to allow developers to prioritize their time on which bugs to address first. These issues can also be assigned to a developer which promotes collaborative work and efficient management of work.

**Exploratory Testing** is a method where testers designs and executes tests based on their own understanding of the system. It requires the tester to think critically, be creative and knowledge of the system to identify potential problems the client may encounter. 

**Manual scripted testing** is the traditional and strucutred method of software testing. The tester is given a pre-defined set of test cases which is typically generated from the system's design requirements. The provided test cases should include a unique test case number, description, initial state of system and expected results. The person designing the test cases must be very skillful whereas the person testing the system does not, since they are already given detailed instructions on what to do. 

**Regression testing** is a type of test to ensure that the system has not introduced new bugs to the new version of the system from fixing bugs from the previous version. It is also used to validate that the bugs reported has been properly addressed. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

1. Initial Familiarization: Testers will gain understanding of the system by reading the high level requirements of the ATM system and going through the application.
2. Functionality testing: Testers will focus on the core functionalities of the system such as withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries and fund transfers. Exploring different scenarios and user roles.
3. Error handling: Deliberately input incorrect data or perform out of order operations to observe system's error handling capabilities / response.
4. Security access: Verify PIN entry processes and card retention scenarios.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

In the process of testing a program that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), a comparison between exploratory testing and manual functional testing reveals distinct strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Exploratory testing stands out for its flexibility and adaptability, making it highly effective for simulating real-world user behaviors and uncovering unexpected bugs. However, its lack of structure can lead to oversight of important scenarios, and issues discovered might be challenging to reproduce. On the other hand, manual functional testing, particularly when utilizing a predefined test suite, ensures comprehensive coverage of all specified ATM functionalities. This method excels in consistency and reproducibility of results. Despite this, its scope is limited to pre-planned scenarios, potentially missing out on unforeseen issues, and can be quite time-consuming. Ultimately, combining the creativity and adaptability of exploratory testing with the thoroughness and reliability of manual functional testing forms a more holistic approach, leading to robust and reliable ATM software. This balanced methodology ensures not only that each defined function is rigorously tested, but also that there is room for uncovering and addressing unexpected real-world scenarios.

- Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
  system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided

**Exploratory Testing**

Two groups perform independent exploratory tests for half an hour each, combine their issues and remove any duplicate issues if any. 

Group 1:

Group 2: 

**Manual scripted testing**

Each group has a driver and a tracker. A driver executes the test case on the system, and the tracker keeps track of which tests have been performed and provide instructions on performing the task.

Group 1:

    Driver:

    Tracker:

Group 2:

    Driver:

    Tracker:

**Regression testing:**

Split defects found from exploratory and manual scripted evenly between memebers and perform regression testing individually.
